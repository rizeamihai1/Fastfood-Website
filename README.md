# Restaurant Website

This is a fully functional restaurant website featuring multiple pages, including a home page, menu, contact form, login page, and a 404 error page. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and includes a login system that uses a JSON-based database for user authentication.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/restaurant-website.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
    ```sh
    cd restaurant-website
    ```
3. Open the project using Visual Studio Code or any other code editor with Live Server support.
4. Start the Live Server to serve the files correctly, as the login system requires JSON fetching:
    - In VS Code, right-click `index.html` and select **Open with Live Server**.
    - Alternatively, use the Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + P) and search for **Live Server: Open with Live Server**.

Now, the website should be running on `http://127.0.0.1:5500/` (or another assigned port).
